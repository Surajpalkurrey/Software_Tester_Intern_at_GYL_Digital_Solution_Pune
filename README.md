**Manual testing** is a crucial part of software development. Unlike automated testing, it involves a person actively using the software to find bugs and issues. This hands-on approach helps ensure the software works as intended and meets user needs.

**What is Manual Testing**
Manual testing is a software testing technique in which testers evaluate the functionality and features of an application by executing test cases manually, without the use of automated tools. In this process, testers create and follow predefined test cases to verify the software's behavior and identify defects. After completing the tests, they document and report the results.

Although manual testing is time-consuming and susceptible to human error, it is an essential step in the software development lifecycle. Every new application must undergo manual testing before considering automation. This helps assess the feasibility of automation and ensures critical functionalities work as expected.

Manual testing does not require knowledge of any specific testing tools, making it accessible for beginners. Despite its limitations, it plays a vital role in ensuring software quality, especially in scenarios where human judgment and exploratory testing are crucial.

**Steps in Manual Testing**

Requirement Analysis: Study the software project documentation, guides, and Application Under Test (AUT). Analyze the requirements from SRS.
Test Plan Creation: Create a test plan covering all the requirements.
Test Case Creation: Design the test cases that cover all the requirements described in the documentation.
Test Case Execution: Review and baseline the test cases with the team lead and client. Execute the test cases on the application under test.
Defect Logging: Detect the bugs, log and report them to the developers.
Defect Fix and Re-verification: When bugs are fixed, again execute the failing test cases to verify they pass.

Tools Used for Manual Testing
Here are the Tools Used for Manual Testing in the proper descriptive form.

1. **Test Link:** It is a web-based test management system that facilitates software quality assurance, and it is one of the most user-friendly programs. It is available through a browser connected to the internet. This manual software testing tool support various programming language.

Support cross-browser testing across different platform.
Facility to record and playback functionality for test automation.
2. **Bugzilla:** It is a web-based bug-tracking tool that is developed by Mozilla. It has a simple bug search that searches the complete text of the bug. It supports various OS like Mac, Windows, and Linux.

Facility to list the software bug in different format.
Bugzilla has advance searching facility.
3. **Jira:** It is a manual testing tool that helps teams assign, track, report, and manage work and bring teams together. This tool is compatible with agile software projects also. It have an option to track and manage bugs and defects and prioritize and assign tasks.

Collaborate with team members.
Easily generate reports and track progress.
4. **LoadRunner**: It is one of the most widely used performance testing tools. The primary purpose of this tool is to categorize the most prevalent causes of performance problems. It simulates real-world user behavior and load and identifies bottlenecks and performance issues.

Scalable architecture for large-scale testing.
Provides detailed reports and analysis.
5. **Apache JMeter:** It is an open-source load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services. It has an easy-to-use user interface. It simulates various types of load (web, database, etc.). It have Highly configurable and extensible and integrates with various plugins for additional features.

Provides comprehensive performance reports and graphs.

6. **Perfecto:** It is a software which is used to do manual testing specifically for mobile user interface. It consists of various mobile devices screen resolutions which allows us to test the user interface of mobile view with various screen virtual devices and Provides real device user interface experiences. Developers can also use this to pre-validate their developed code to test for all versions.

For example, it provides the exact screen resolution of iPhone, Samsung, iPad, Pixel and so on depends on requirements needed.
Provides good test environment to find the defects.
It allows supports some tablet screen resolutions like iPad.
Characteristics of Manual Testing
Human Performance: Human testers who use the product the same way as end users conduct manual testing. Manually carrying out test cases, testers provide input and watch the result to find errors.
Investigative Testing: Exploratory testing, in which testers examine the application without using pre-defined test cases, is a common component of manual testing. This method aids in locating unforeseen problems and evaluating the user experience.
Flexibility: Throughout the testing process, testers can adjust to changing conditions and requirements. Based on their observations, they can adapt test cases or investigate new ideas.
Initial Testing: Early in the software development life cycle, even before the program is fully developed, manual testing can be started. By doing exploratory testing, testers can find problems early in the development process.
Examining Complex Situations: When testing complex scenarios that could be difficult to automate, manual testing works well. Testers can evaluate the interactions between various components and through complex workflows.
Testing User Interfaces (UI): Manual testing is a good way to assess an application's user interface. From a user's point of view, testers can evaluate the general design, responsiveness appearance, and feel.
