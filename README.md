**Manual testing** is a crucial part of software development. Unlike automated testing, it involves a person actively using the software to find bugs and issues. This hands-on approach helps ensure the software works as intended and meets user needs.

**What is Manual Testing**
Manual testing is a software testing technique in which testers evaluate the functionality and features of an application by executing test cases manually, without the use of automated tools. In this process, testers create and follow predefined test cases to verify the software's behavior and identify defects. After completing the tests, they document and report the results.

Although manual testing is time-consuming and susceptible to human error, it is an essential step in the software development lifecycle. Every new application must undergo manual testing before considering automation. This helps assess the feasibility of automation and ensures critical functionalities work as expected.

Manual testing does not require knowledge of any specific testing tools, making it accessible for beginners. Despite its limitations, it plays a vital role in ensuring software quality, especially in scenarios where human judgment and exploratory testing are crucial.

**Steps in Manual Testing**

Requirement Analysis: Study the software project documentation, guides, and Application Under Test (AUT). Analyze the requirements from SRS.
Test Plan Creation: Create a test plan covering all the requirements.
Test Case Creation: Design the test cases that cover all the requirements described in the documentation.
Test Case Execution: Review and baseline the test cases with the team lead and client. Execute the test cases on the application under test.
Defect Logging: Detect the bugs, log and report them to the developers.
Defect Fix and Re-verification: When bugs are fixed, again execute the failing test cases to verify they pass.

Characteristics of Manual Testing
Human Performance: Human testers who use the product the same way as end users conduct manual testing. Manually carrying out test cases, testers provide input and watch the result to find errors.
Investigative Testing: Exploratory testing, in which testers examine the application without using pre-defined test cases, is a common component of manual testing. This method aids in locating unforeseen problems and evaluating the user experience.
Flexibility: Throughout the testing process, testers can adjust to changing conditions and requirements. Based on their observations, they can adapt test cases or investigate new ideas.
Initial Testing: Early in the software development life cycle, even before the program is fully developed, manual testing can be started. By doing exploratory testing, testers can find problems early in the development process.
Examining Complex Situations: When testing complex scenarios that could be difficult to automate, manual testing works well. Testers can evaluate the interactions between various components and through complex workflows.
Testing User Interfaces (UI): Manual testing is a good way to assess an application's user interface. From a user's point of view, testers can evaluate the general design, responsiveness appearance, and feel.
